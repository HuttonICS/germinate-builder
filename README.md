# Germinate Builder

The Germinate Builder is a tool to automate the deployment-process of Germinate.
Once set up, it only takes a few mouse clicks to deploy any number of Germinate instances to the servers. This significantly simplifies the distribution of new versions of Germinate.

Please consult the [Wiki](../../wiki) for help with getting things set up and running.
