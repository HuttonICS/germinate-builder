# Germinate Builder

**This repository has been archived on 2020-03-27. With the release of Germinate 4.0.0 and the docker containers made available on DockerHub, this software is obsolete.**

The Germinate Builder is a tool to automate the deployment-process of Germinate.
Once set up, it only takes a few mouse clicks to deploy any number of Germinate instances to the servers. This significantly simplifies the distribution of new versions of Germinate.

Please consult the [Wiki](../../wiki) for help with getting things set up and running.
